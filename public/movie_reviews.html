<h1>Jithesh's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>My three favorite films of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Bridges of Madison County</h3>
<p>Beautiful film.  This is the first film where I sas Meryl Streep.  I didn't know about her before.
I was like "Who's that?" All the mannerisms, accent, vulnerability, mischief and storytelling were all so marvelous.  When I googled, everywhere it
was said that she was one of the greatest actors of all time. Clint Eastwood is one my
favorite directors.  The story is told so simply, yet strong.  Of course by
end of the film I cry in buckets.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is one of the best films ever made.  More than that it is about hope.
   For example, this course is long.  The beginning seems to be easy, when I
   scroll down, I see a lot of terms I don't know, and it is scary.  In the film,
   Andy scratches the wall for several years to dig a tunnel to his freedom. Likewise,
   may be if dig a bit everyday, I'll reach the end of this course and find light
   and success.

<h3>400 blows</h3>
<p>First of all this is in the French New Wave era, which I am always excited
   about.  It is a coming of age film, depicting a lot of little struggles we
   experience as kids when growing up, which I can relate to.
