<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a physics researcher turned actor currently pursuing acting, film making and theater making in NYC.  
    I was born in India in Kerala.  It is called God's Own Country, green, coconut trees all over the place and many rivers.  
    Yes! We use coconut everywhere from curries to hair oil! After receiving PhD in Physics from Bangalore, India I worked in 
    research labs in France, Germany and USA.  In the USA, I have worked in universities and national labs like 
    Boston University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

    I began helping students since I was fifteen; in high school to buy books that I loved to read and later in 
    college to meet my studying expenses. After master, for two years, I worked as a lecturer and taught Physics
     and Maths to masters and bachelors students.  During the course of my PhD and post-doctoral studies I was 
     assigned students for mentoring. I read Sri Narayana Guru's and Guru Nitya Chaitanya Yati's works to understand 
     human mind and to help myself live a fulfilling life. In the last few years Luis Hay's works and writing have 
     been having healthy influence on my life and well being.

    I love animals and grew up around dogs and cats, lots of them; there were snakes too, but I was lovingly 
    scared of them. I love elephants and watched them with affectionate eyes when mahouts led them to temples 
    for festivals along the road in front of my home.  I gather crying one whole day asking my father to buy 
    me an elephant.  I fantasize adopting an elephant in one of elephant sanctuaries in Kerala.

    I love inline skating and swimming.  I love dancing.  I sing Bollywood, Indian semi-classical and pop 
    songs.  I am passionate about coding.  I am continuing learning Physics and Mathematics and look forward 
    to studying in depth the works of masters like Dirac and Ramanujan.  Now I am acting and doing theater 
    and film making in New York City.  I feel anyone can do anything if they really want to do it.  
    The potential of human mind is infinite. I desire to money to visit orphanages in Kerala and support
    the education of children there.  I want to spread the idea of "neighborhood sharing" where parents
    are motivated to support the education of a neighboring kid who cannot afford it by buying books or 
    any other means.
